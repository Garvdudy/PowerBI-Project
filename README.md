# Power BI — Data Professional Survey Breakdown

## Overview
This project analyzes a global survey of data professionals to understand compensation, satisfaction, preferred technologies, roles, and experience levels. I transformed raw survey data into a structured data model and designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover meaningful insights.

## Project Methodology
- Imported raw Excel survey file into Power BI
- Cleaned data using Power Query Editor (replace nulls, fix inconsistent text, trim values)
- Split compound fields (e.g., salary ranges) into usable columns
- Created calculated columns (e.g., numeric salary estimates)
- Validated table relationships through Table View & Model View
- designed visuals that support storytelling — not just reporting

## Key Learnings
- End-to-end BI workflow (clean → transform → model → visualize)
- Creating interactive dashboards using slicers & filters
- Matching visual charts to insights (salary trends, satisfaction, tech usage)
- Stronger understanding of Power BI data modeling & DAX fundamentals

## Dashboard Highlights
- Average salary by job role (Data Analyst, Engineer, Scientist, etc.)
- Salary satisfaction visualized through a Gauge
- Top programming languages ranked by popularity
- Slicers for Region, Experience Level, Job Title

## Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Power BI
- Power Query Editor (ETL)
- Model View (relationships)
- Calculated Columns & DAX Logic
- Interactive Charts (Bar, Column, Gauge, Pie)
- Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Outcome
This project demonstrates my ability to transform survey data into **business-ready insights** using Power BI. The final dashboard makes exploration easy and supports strategic decisions with a clean, interactive visual experience.
